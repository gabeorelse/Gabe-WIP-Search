I'm the kind of person who learns by building from the ground up. For this project, that meant narrowing my scope to:
-a small unstructured database
-a single web page
-a single .js file
-an API written in Python

I'm currently teaching myself HTML/CSS and Javascript so at the time of making this project I had to fumble through a very basic html/css/js form. I'm excited to see my frontend capabilities improve on my next project.
